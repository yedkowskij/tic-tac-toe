# Tic-Tac-Toe Game – CS50 Python Final Project  

Hello, my name is **Artur Jodkowski**, and this is my **CS50 Python final project**.  
This project is a **Tic-Tac-Toe game** with multiple difficulty levels and an AI opponent.

## How It Works  

1. **Welcome Screen:**  
   - You are greeted with a welcome message.  
   - Press **ENTER** to start.  

2. **Choose Settings:**  
   - Select the difficulty level:  
     - **Easy:** Random moves.  
     - **Medium:** Blocks your winning moves.  
     - **Hard:** Tries to win or block you.  
     - **Impossible:** Uses the **Minimax Algorithm** (unbeatable).  
   - Enter the board size (e.g., 3x3).  

3. **Gameplay:**  
   - You always play as **X (crosses)**, and the computer as **O (circles).**  
   - Enter a number to place your move.  

4. **Results:**  
   - The program announces the winner or a draw.  
   - You can choose to **play again or exit.**
